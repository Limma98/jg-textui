This is a just a little bit of love added to the jg-textui ( i take no credit for the origanl script itself .
Credit still goes to Jg
just added a little bit of floating animation and a glow pulse to the textui 
colours can be changed within the css files to suit your needs :)

# jg-textui

Show text UI:

```lua
exports['jg-textui']:DrawText(text)
